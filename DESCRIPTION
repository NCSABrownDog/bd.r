Description: Researchers in these disciplines sometimes require to work with or to explore their difficult datasets.  Towards this they could leverage the Brown Dog Services (DAP/DTS). For ease of the researchers, we built a R library that wraps Brown Dog REST API and provides modules to identify the conversion options for a file/dataset, to convert file/dataset to appropriate format, to index collections and to query collections. This R library can also be easily integrated with other statistical software written in R. So, the researcher need not require learning a new programming language and prior knowledge of R is sufficient to use Brown Dog services.
