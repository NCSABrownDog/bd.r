Description: Researchers in these disciplines sometimes require to work with or to explore their difficult 
    datasets. For ease of the researchers, we built a R package that wraps Brown Dog REST API and provides 
    modules to identify the conversion options for a file/dataset, to convert file/dataset to appropriate 
    format.  Towards this they could leverage the Brown Dog Services (DAP/DTS). For ease of the researchers, 
    we built a R package that wraps Brown Dog REST API and provides modules to identify the conversion 
    options for a file/dataset, to convert file/dataset to appropriate format, to index collections and to 
    query collections. This R package can also be easily integrated with other statistical software written 
    in R. So, the researcher need not require learning a new programming language and prior knowledge of R 
    is sufficient to use Brown Dog services.
